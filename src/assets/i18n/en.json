When he chooses photos after the session, he looks for those which, thanks to their naturalness, make people think. Because the point is not that the photo should be 'nice'. 'Nice' ceased to be enough for him a long time ago. He would like the photo to evoke a smile, tears of happiness, thought and interest.",
  "AboutUsP1": "We have been operating in the IT industry for several years, each of us has many years of experience in creating and maintaining various types of websites and internet services. We build websites with the utmost care and attention to detail, and we write high-quality search engine-friendly code.",

  "AboutUsP3": "When a website is launched using a WordPress or Joomla CMS, it is overloaded with functionalities that are mostly not used. Our code is not overloaded with unnecessary features that you will probably never use.",
  "AboutUsP4": "In CMS such as WordPress, the user of such a page downloads more megabytes (which, for example, increases the use of cellular data packages), so the website may run slower. The above-mentioned problems do not exist on the websites we create - we only create functionalities that the website requires. Thanks to this, we save time and energy because our websites load faster and run smoother."
